# myCheckIn Journal
> A personal mini-journal on your computer!

## About
myCheckIn Journal is a desktop application for people to write down 
their thoughts and feelings.

## Inspiration
Although writing by hand activates more parts of the brain than typing,
there is the issue of productivity, convenience, and security. In our
hectic world, time is of the essence. With a traditional paper
journal, you'd take more time writing as well as fixing any mistakes you
may make. Also, your journal may get in the hands of nosy siblings and
relatives, with enough determination. Therefore, I want to create a digital
journaling app with Java.

## User Stories
