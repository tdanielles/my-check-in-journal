# myCheckIn Journal
> A personal mini-journal on your computer!

## About
myCheckIn Journal is a desktop application for people to write down 
their thoughts and feelings.

## Inspiration
Although writing by hand activates more parts of the brain than typing,
there is the issue of productivity, convenience, and security. In our
hectic world, time is of the essence. With a traditional paper
journal, you'd take more time writing as well as fixing any mistakes you
may make. Also, your journal may get in the hands of nosy siblings and
relatives, with enough determination. Therefore, I want to create a digital
journaling app with Java.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a new entry to the journal.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an existing entry in the journal.
- As a user, I want to be able to select an entry from the journal and view it
    in detail.
- As a user, I want to view a list of all the titles of the entries I have in the
journal.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my journal to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my journal from file.

## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required event by clicking the "New entry" button and entering
all required fields, and finally clicking the "Add" button. The new entry will then be displayed on the panel where 
it says "Your entries". Note that for this action to be saved, you must click the "Save activities" button.
- You can generate the second required event by clicking the "See more" button on the particular
entry card you want to view in detail.
- You can locate my visual component by running the JournalAppGUI class (loading screen).
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the "Save activities" button.
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the "Load entries" button.
